# 69. Sqrt(x)

## Question

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Ideas

Improved: Binary Search. 

This problem asks us to find out the largest integer that meets `num * num <= x`, so we can use binary search to find out the right bound within the range (1, x).

## Highlights

**How to avoid the overflow?**

* mid = start + (end - start) / 2
* mid == x / mid

**When x >= 2, the Square root is always smaller than x/2.**

            }
        }
        return end;
    }
}
