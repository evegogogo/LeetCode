# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

## Question

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `N` piles of bananas, the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `H` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `K`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `K` bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.

Return the minimum integer `K` such that she can eat all the bananas within `H` hours.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], H = 8
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 5
Output: 30
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
Output: 23
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
- `piles.length <= H <= 10^9`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

## Ideas

Every hour, Koko chooses a pile and eats K bananas from the pile. Koko needs to eat all the bananas within H hours, but there's a limit K. We need to find out the minimum K. So we can use a Binary Search to narrow down the range and find out the min.

## Highlights

**How to identify a problem can be solved by Binary Search?**

**Make the start and end meaningful.**

// Time Complexity: O(nlog(w)), n is the size of the piles and W is the maximum size of the pile.
