# 450. Delete Node in a BST

## Question

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Note:** Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

**Example:**

```
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
```

## Ideas

Intuition:

When the node has been found (`key == node.val`): 

1. node doesn't have any children, so we delete it by returning null.

2. node has a left subtree, we return the left subtree.

3. node has a right subtree, we return the right subtree.

4. node has both, we need to find out the successor or predecessor, set that value to the current node, and delete the successor or predecessor.

## Highlights

**In-order traversal of BST: a non-decreasing array.**

**Find a successor: go to the right once and then to the left until the end.**

```java
public int successor(TreeNode root) {
  root = root.right;
  while (root.left != null) root = root.left;
  return root;
} 
```

 **Find a predecessor: go to the left once and then to the right until the end.**

```java
public int predecessor(TreeNode root) {
  root = root.left;
  while (root.right != null) root = root.right;
  return root;
} 
```
