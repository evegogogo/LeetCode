# Binary Search

## Question

Given an **sorted** integer array - nums, and an integer - target.

Find **any/first/last** position of target in nums.

return **-1** if target does not exist.

## Performance

T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) = **O(log n)**

Use the required **Time Complexity** to guess the **Way** to solve the problem.

## Type
